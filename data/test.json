Real world doesn’t fucking work that way. Get out of tumblr. Get the fuck out and see the real world. It’s so fucking sad that y'all literally are soooo deluded and brainwashed by mra propaganda. Really. <i><b>Misandry is a LIE</b></i>. It doesn’t exist. It just doesn’t. There are currently ZERO countries where women systematically oppress men. There are zero countries where men have their humanity and rights questioned because they’re male. Zero. 0. Total 0. Men literally, in every sense, hold all the power. For all the things men have done to women throughout millenias, they should be thankful that we are not waging war for revenge. Women are never and will never be as hateful and deranged.
